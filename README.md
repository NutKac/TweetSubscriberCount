# Tweet subscriber count + Subscriber goal
Twython script for Raspberry Pi. Tweet the current subscriber count for a youtube channel + subscriber goal. 

Enter you own keys in TweetSubscriberCount.py.

Change the channel name, subscriber goal and the twittername.

This is my first project, so feedback is appreciated.
